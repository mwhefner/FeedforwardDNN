# FeedforwardDNN

A full description and annotation can be found [on my website](http://matthefner.com/deeplearning.html).

This is an implementation of an illustrative Deep Feedforward Network in Python.

DNN.py is the model, and DNN_results.py was used to achieve the results featured on my website.

To use these programs, the .npy MNIST and pickled CIFAR data must be in a subdirectory of the directory in which they are ran.  The subdirectories must be named "./MNIST/", "./CIFAR10/", and "./CIFAR100/".
